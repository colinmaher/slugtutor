tutor and student profile and evreything else is differed

Two databases

A tutor database and a student database

its ok if they're both students


I can manage both easily, I can have some team members work on one database 

i wouldnt need databases for class or session

Those would fields of both tutor, student databases

 Big opening page, asks if student or tutor

 Each student has to register
 validating ucsc address

 Tutor can set an hourly rate
 name, about me, hourly rate

 50% payment up front, 50 after session

 3-4 hour reschedule window

 Facilitate collaborative tutoring sessions

 One person can signup for a session, and say how many people are coming

 tutor can choose to offer ind or group tutoring

 Getting everything to display is tricky

 I need to limit the size of image prof pic uploads

 Dont worry about cropping tool

 5 star rating option, maybe also have likes

 Stretch to built in messaging

 Right now, an email is good for communication

 ***** Class profiles, what the class is about, resources for the class,
 class links to the UCSC webpage, class instructor's email, TA, *****

 Might need an independent class database. This can be a public database.

 Peer tutor validation?

 Consecutive low ratings -> qualifaction test, ask why hes getting low ratings

 Initial testing would drive the tutors away

 Have ppl sign academic integerity policy
